# Task Breakdown

This file enumerates the major tasks required to design and implement the Rust-based IdP. Tasks are grouped by phase as outlined in the roadmap.

## Phase 1: Research & Requirements
- [ ] Document authentication needs for agents and services.
- [ ] Compare Rust crates for web frameworks (Axum vs Actix Web).
- [ ] Evaluate OAuth2 libraries and JWT signing crates.
- [ ] Define performance targets and acceptable latency metrics.

## Phase 2: Initial Prototype (MVP)
- [ ] Set up repository with Cargo workspace and continuous integration.
- [ ] Implement basic HTTP server exposing `/token` endpoint.
- [ ] Store service account credentials in SQLite.
- [ ] Provide a script/CLI to create new service accounts.

## Phase 3: Core Security & Persistence
- [ ] Integrate PostgreSQL and Diesel/SQLx for database access.
- [ ] Implement rotating key management for JWT signing.
- [ ] Add role-based permissions and simple policy checks.
- [ ] Record all token issuance events to audit logs.

## Phase 4: Performance & Observability
- [ ] Introduce in-memory caching layer for identity lookups.
- [ ] Profile request latency and optimize slow paths.
- [ ] Export metrics and traces with Prometheus and OpenTelemetry.

## Phase 5: Feature Expansion
- [ ] Add OAuth2 client credentials flow with token revocation.
- [ ] Provide API endpoints for token rotation and revocation.
- [ ] Publish example SDKs or usage snippets for agents.

## Phase 6: Production Readiness
- [ ] Containerize the service and define Kubernetes/Docker deployment files.
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and releases.
- [ ] Write integration tests covering authentication and edge cases.
- [ ] Perform security audits and fuzz testing before release.
